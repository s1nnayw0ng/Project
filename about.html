        <h1>Why go ‘wild’ swimming?</h1>
        <article>
            <h2>Diving In</h2>
        <section>
            <p>There is something slightly naughty, a little bit scary and wonderfully invigorating about leaving your wetsuit at home, and entering open water with just your skin (and perhaps a swimming costume) between you and the elements.
                Freed from the thermal and neoprene protection of a wetsuit, cold water immersion provides a sense of elation and relaxation, 
                soothes muscle aches, relieves depression and boosts the immune system. It’s also a fantastically convenient way to explore 
                the countryside, with no kit to lug around. 
            </p>
            <p>The health and psychological benefits of dipping in natural waters have been long known. George Bernard Shaw, Benjamin Britten, 
                Charles Darwin and Florence Nightingale were all advocates of regular cold baths to strengthen the mental constitution and physical 
                state. And all wild-dippers know the natural endorphin high that raises mood, elates the senses and creates an addictive urge to dive 
                back in, and sets the day off to a fantastic start.
            </p>
            <p>The vaso dilation in the extremities also pumps out toxin, and the cold water starts a process of cold adaptation, which quickly 
            builds your cold tolerance, make cold water feel more comfortable, and your body more healthy.
            </p>

         <h2 class="secondary">Can anyone do it?</h2>
         <section>
            <p>Open water swimming is for everyone of all abilities and age groups as long as you have the ability and
                confidence to swim without
                being able to put your feet down.</p>
            <p>Remember it’s very likely you’ll be out of your depth for some of the time (if not most of the time).</p>
            <p>You can take it as seriously or as casually as you want to, from social swimming to elite level. All we ask
                is that you try and
                enjoy what you do.</p>

         <h2 class="secondary">Health benefits of wild swimming</h2>
         <section>
            <p>The health and psychological benefits of dipping in natural waters have long been known, as our many spa
                towns are testament to.
                Florence Nightingale and Charles Dicken both claimed to have been cured by these traditional forms of
                ‘hydrotherapy’.</p>
            <p>A powerful endorphin shot is released and this natural high bringing on intense feelings of well being and an
                addictive urge to
                dive back in. Third, after regular swimming, a process known as cold adaptation kicks in. Not only does this
                reduce your body’s
                sensation of coldness (making even the coldest water quite pleasant), it is clinically proven to boost mode,
                libido and the
                immune system – as shown in NASA experiments from the 1980s. Coldwater swimming is also a sure-fire way to
                burn calories quickly
                and building muscle tone and graceful technique.</p>
            <p>People also explain that wild swimming is a very good way to de-stress, and acts like a form of mindfulness
                or meditation,
                bringing them into the moment, focusing their mind on the physical sensations, and taking them away from
                their worries and concerns.
                In some ways it is the perfect digital detox.</p>

            <p class="span-all">Important health disclaimer and other considerations..</p>
        <p>The recommendations of these swimming spots does not indicate that these are always safe spots to swim.
            Although there are lots of benefits to wild swimming there are also some risks.
            You are responsible for checking these risks and for your own safety when swimming at these spots. Water
            quality/safety can be
            affected by many things, including heavy rainfall so always ensure it is safe to get in the water before you
            swim. 
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
        </p>

        <h3>Other risks to look out for:</h3>
        <ul class="safety">
            <li> If jumping into the water, please check the height of the fall and the depth of the water </li>
            <li> Be careful of objects in the water such as sharp rocks. These may not always be visible</li>
            <li> Take extra care when swimming alone but it is preferable to always go with another person</li>
            <li> Strong currents that can sweep you away very quickly</li>
            <li> Water pollution </li>
        </ul>
