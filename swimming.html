            <p>The Forty Foot, a historic bathing pool at the southern tip of Dublin Bay,
                has been named among the best places to swim in the world by the NYT.
                Once a male only swimming spot, The Forty Foot near Dún Laoghaire in
                South Dublin is now open to everyone young and old to swim there.
                People have been swimming in the Irish Sea all year round for some
                250 years.

            <h3 class="galleryh3">Gormire Lake in Hambleton, North Yorkshire</h3>
            <p> Gormire Lake - also known as the White Mere - was formed by
                glacial erosion over 20,000 years ago, making it a remnant of the
                last Ice Age, its one of only four natural lakes in Yorkshire.
                Gormire roughly translates as 'filthy swamp', but that has not
                stopped the lake becoming a go-to choice for plenty of wild swimmers.
                The lake in North York Moors National Park has no inflow or major
                outflow of water and is thought to be fed by an underground spring.

            <p>Dive into the largest body of freshwater in the UK and brave the
                chilly temperatures of Loch Ness for one of the UK’s most iconic open water swims.
                Loch Nessis a large, deep, freshwater loch in the Scottish Highlands
                extending for approximately 37 kilometres (23 miles) southwest of
                Inverness. Its surface is 16 metres (52 feet) above sea level.

            <p>Port Meadow is one of the largest open spaces in the north of
                city (136.9ha). With the River Thames flowing through the heart of
                the meadow the flood plains are home to many species of cattle,
                horses and wildfowl. Swim in the river Thames without all the
                city grub - the water in Port Meadow is so clear it's hard to
                believe that it is the same river as the murky trail that snakes
                throught London. The grassy banks have natural bays, ideal for
                sitting down with a picnic punctuated by repeated dips.
